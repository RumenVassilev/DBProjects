There are 4 types of database models:
1. Hierarchical (tree)
2. Network / graph
3. Relational (tables)
4. Object-oriented

The most common model is the relational, but I'm going to write a few lines for the hierarchical.
It is organized into a tree- like structure. There are links between the records and if you want to picture it better
see the Windows file system, it is a great example of tree-like structure. Each record can have just one parent and each rocord 
can have one or more child records. It needs to be traversed starting from the root. It is the first database model
created by IBM in the 60's.
