Database scheme normalization is a procces of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database
to minmize data redundancy. It is bassicaly decomposing a table into smaller tables to avoid and minimize
redundancy. The easiest way is by defining foregn keys in the old table referencing the primary keys
of the new ones.

Normalized tables are smaller which makes them easier to worik with and the updates are fast and accurate.
However there are some issues with normalized tables. The main one is that connections (joins) between tables
are causing read operations to suffer because indexing strategies don't go well with table joins.
