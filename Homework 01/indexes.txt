The index is a structure of the database table the value of one or more columns to sort.
Disadvantegs: In some cases, the indexing words may not be fast, for example, the index is placed in a 
contiguous memory space, which will increase the burden of disk read, which is optimal, 
it should be through the actual use of the environment to be tested.
