NoSQL (non-relational) databases
Use document-based model (non-relational)
Schema-free document storage
Still support CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
Still support indexing and querying
Still supports concurrency  and transactions
Highly optimized for append / retrieve
Great performance and scalability
NoSQL == “No SQL” or “Not Only SQL”?
Relational databases
Data stored as table rows
Relationships between related rows
Single entity spans multiple tables
RDBMS systems are very mature, rock solid
NoSQL databases
Data stored as documents
Single entity (document) is a single record
Documents do not have a fixed structure
