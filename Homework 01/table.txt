Database tables consists of data, arranged in rows and (fields) columns, where all rows have the same
structure and columns have name and type.
Table is another term for relation; although there is the difference in that a table is 
usually a multiset (bag) of rows where a relation is a set and does not allow duplicates. 
Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have associated with them some metadata, 
such as constraints on the table or on the values within particular columns
